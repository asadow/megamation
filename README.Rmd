The goal of `megamation` is to facilitate [Megamation](https://megamation.com/) data downloads in R. It wraps the [REST API](https://apidocs.megamation.com/) so that each API endpoint (a URL with parameters) becomes an R function with documented arguments.

`megamation` also contains and implements functions to

-   Expose important details from HTTP errors in R errors.
-   Provide a paginate function for large downloads.
-   Caches responses to GET requests that have status code 200 and at least one of the standard caching headers (e.g. Expires, Etag, Last-Modified, Cache-Control)

## Installation

You can install the development version of `megamation` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("asadow/megamation")
```

## Authorization

Your Megamation representative will provide your key and URL. A helper function is provided to install these credentials (it creates name-value pairs in your `.Renviron` file, a safe place for secrets.) Edit and run the function below:

``` r
library(megamation)
mm_set_creds(
   key = "<YOUR-MEGAMATION_KEY>",
   url = "<YOUR-MEGAMATION_URL>"
   )
```

### Authorization without `mm_set_creds()`

To set credentials yourself, you can open your `.Renviron` (`usethis::edit_r_environ()`) and enter each `NAME = "VALUE"` on separate lines like so.

``` r
MEGAMATION_KEY = "R&RwillNeverDie"
MEGAMATION_URL = "https://api.megamation.com/uog/dl"
```

You will then need to restart R to load them. Or you can use 
`Sys.setenv(NAME = "VALUE")`.

``` r
Sys.setenv(MEGAMATION_KEY = "R&RwillNeverDie")
Sys.setenv(MEGAMATION_URL = "https://api.megamation.com/uog/dl")
```

## A simple request

With your credentials installed, you can request any endpoint using `mm_pull()`. Here we request the `"trade"` endpoint.

```{r eval = FALSE}
trade <- mm_pull("trade")
```

## Building a custom request

`mm_req()` allows you to define a request for any endpoint endpoint: `"timecard"`, `"workorder"`, etc.

```{r}
library(megamation)
req <- mm_req("timecard", date = I("<>09-01-2023,09-02-2023"))
```

You can optionally paginate the request by using `mm_req_paginate()`.

```{r}
# req <- req |> mm_req_paginate()
```

Here I run `httr2::req_dry_run()` to show exactly what `httr2` will send to the server, without actually sending it.

```{r}
req |> httr2::req_dry_run()
```

### Performing the request

If you added pagination,  use `mm_req_paginate_perform()` to perform the request. If not, use `httr2::req_perform()`. The value returned is a Megamation API response. 

The body of the response will contain raw bytes. It can be parsed using `body_parse()`. The parsed response is a list which includes the data. If you are only interested in the data, you can skip `body_parse()` and simply use `mm_resp_data()`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
resp <- req |> httr2::req_perform() 
df <- resp |> mm_resp_data()
```
