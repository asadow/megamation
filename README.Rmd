## Overview

megamation provides an R interface to [Megamation DirectLine](https://megamation.com/) via the [API](https://apidocs.megamation.com/). 

## Installation

You can install the released version of megamation from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("megamation")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("asadow/megamation")
```

## Attach megamation

```{r}
library(megamation)
```

## Authorization

`mm_set_creds()` installs your API credentials:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
mm_set_creds(
  key = "<YOUR-MEGAMATION_KEY>",
  url = "<YOUR-MEGAMATION_URL>"
)
```

## Get Data

`mm_get()` makes a GET request to an endpoint:

```{r}
mm_get("status")
```

It provides informative R errors (alongside HTTP errors):

```{r, error = TRUE}
mm_get("statuses")
```

### Filter Requests

`mm_get()` allows you to easily filter requests by fields.

Let's try to request two work orders by their work order numbers:

```{r, error = TRUE}
mm_get("workorder", wo_no = c("00001", "00002"))
```

Uh oh! `wo_no` is not available as a filterable field (yet). You can ask your Megamation representative to add it.

#### Available Filters

`mm_get_names()` allows you to see which of your fields you can currently filter by:

```{r}
mm_get_names("workorder")
```

#### Modifiers

You can use Megamation's [modifiers](https://apidocs.megamation.com/) on your field values. For example, `[]` means "containing". Supply `<field> = "[]<value>"` to get rows where `<field>` contains `<value>`. For example, the following requests all work orders containing trades `ADMIN` and `IT`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
admin_and_it <- c("[]ADMIN", "[]IT")

mm_get("workorder", trade = admin_and_it)
#> # Data Not Shown for Privacy
```

#### Dates

The `date` field argument only accepts values of type `Date`. The following requests all work orders from January, 2023:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
jan_2023 <- seq.Date(
  as.Date("2023-01-01"),
  as.Date("2023-01-31"),
  by = "day"
)

mm_get("workorder", date = jan_2023)
#> # Data Not Shown for Privacy
```
