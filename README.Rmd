## Overview

megamation provides an R interface to [Megamation DirectLine](https://megamation.com/) via the [API](https://apidocs.megamation.com/). 

## Installation

You can install the released version of megamation from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("megamation")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("asadow/megamation")
```

## Attach megamation

```{r}
library(megamation)
```

## Authorization

You have two options.

Either use `mm_authorize()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mm_authorize(
  key = "<YOUR-MEGAMATION_KEY>",
  url = "<YOUR-MEGAMATION_URL>"
)
```

Or run `usethis::edit_r_environ()` to install your API credentials in your `.Renviron`.

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
MEGAMATION_KEY = '<YOUR-MEGAMATION_KEY>'
MEGAMATION_URL = '<YOUR-MEGAMATION_URL>'
```

Now `megamation` functions will automatically use your credentials, so you don't
have to expose them in your code.

## Grabbing Data

`mm_data()` downloads data from your tables into R.

```{r}
mm_data("status")
```

It provides informative R errors (alongside HTTP errors).

```{r, error = TRUE}
mm_data("statuses")
```

### Filtering

`mm_data()` allows you to easily filter by fields (also known as columns).

Let's try to request two work orders by their work order numbers.

```{r, error = TRUE}
mm_data("workorder", wo_no = c("00001", "00002"))
```

Uh oh! `wo_no` is not available as a filterable field (yet). You can ask your Megamation representative to add it.

#### Available Filters

`mm_names()` allows you to see which columns you can currently use as filters.

```{r}
mm_names("workorder")
```

#### Modifiers

You can use Megamation's [modifiers](https://apidocs.megamation.com/) on filter values.

- `[]` for containing

- `!!` for not equal

- `>>` for greater than

- `<<` for less than

- `<>` for between.

For example, supply `<field> = "[]<value>"` to get rows where `<field>` contains `<value>`. Here's how you would request all work orders containing trades `ADMIN` and `IT`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
admin_and_it <- c("[]ADMIN", "[]IT")

mm_data("workorder", trade = admin_and_it)
#> # Data Not Shown for Privacy
```

#### Dates

Avoid `<>` for dates. Instead, use a sequence of R `Date`'s. Here's how you would request all work orders from January, 2023.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
jan_2023 <- seq.Date(
  as.Date("2023-01-01"),
  as.Date("2023-01-31"),
  by = "day"
)

mm_data("workorder", date = jan_2023)
#> # Data Not Shown for Privacy
```
