Description: Tools for accessing and handling 'DirectLine' data using the 
    'Megamation API' <https://apidocs.megamation.com/>. The API allows users to 
    interact with data programmatically, instead of via the 'DirectLine' 
    software. This package is community-maintained and is not officially 
    supported by Megamation <https://megamation.com/about-megamation/>.
